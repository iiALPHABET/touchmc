#    - %thirdlife_player% returns the player name in the color of their life
#    - %thirdlife_color% returns the color of the life a player is on
#    - %thirdlife_message% only works in the format_chat.format section and returns the players message
#    - %thirdlife_life% returns a bracketed number that corresponds to the life a person is on.
#      this will return null if "max_extra_lives" is set to 0.

#control the max allowed lives and the color for players with more then three lives.
#For instance, setting "max_extra_lives" to 2 would set the max lives to 5 (do not set it to negative numbers).
